Testing files are generated by AI. If you want to test them use Bash. Dont forget to cd folder where main.py and tests are

Current code:

Parses all the specified files.
Looks at mutations in each chromosome.
Generates consensus sequences for the SPECIFIED sample and modifies them (logged as MODIFIED) if a mutation or mutations are included in the current consensus.
Let me know if I understood the task correctly, and I'll proceed with optimization.

Example: python core.py --reference test.fasta --vcf test.vcf --output consensus.fasta --length 10 --total 10 --random --sample sample2
